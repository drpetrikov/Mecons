A free icon pack for GNOME

The icons are made in part by me and in part reuse assets from other icons.
I also used assets from this repository https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/app-icon-requests
Some app icons i've used, in no particular order

-Lorem
-Furtherance
-GNOME Web
-GNOME Files
-Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
-Fractal
-Dissent
-The Adwaita Icon Theme
-Nibbles
-Image Viewer

If it appears i used something you made without credit, tell me, i'd be more than glad to credit you for your work.

Enjoy!
